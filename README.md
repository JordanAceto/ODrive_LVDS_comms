# Set of small PCBs for Odrive ◄► motor encoder comms

- One board sits on an Odrive
- The other goes inside a gimbal motor
- They are connected with twisted pair wire
- The goal is to increase noise immunity and have convenient connectors
- One Odrive board can connect to two encoder boards

### Connectors used
- JST GH series 9 pin

### IMPORTANT!
- The encoder board PCB should be 1mm thick
- The ODRive board can be any thickness you like

### Status
- schematic capture and layout are done
- waiting on boards for testing
